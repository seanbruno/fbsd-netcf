Introduction
============

netcf is a cross-platform network configuration library.

It takes the description of a network interface in its own
platform-independent format and adapts the local system's network
configuration to provide that interface.

As an example, imagine you want to bond eth0 and eth1 together to bond0. On
Fedora, that requires modifying the files ifcfg-eth0, ifcfg-eth1 and
ifcfg-bond0 in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts; on Debian, it requires
changing several entries in /etc/network/interfaces.

This library provides a convenient facility for programs that want to
shield themselves from the intricacies of networking setup.
