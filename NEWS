0.2.2 - 2012-08-25

  - specfile: require libnl3-devel for rpm builds on Fedora 18+ and
    RHEL7+. Likewise, force libnl1 for F17- and RHEL6.x-, even if
    libnl3-devel is installed.

0.2.1 - 2012-08-10
  - update gnulib to fix broken build on systems with nwer glibc (which no
    longer provides gets()).
  - add ncftool manpage
  - interfaces are only "active" if both UP and RUNNING.

0.2.0 - 2012-07-20
  - add support for Ubuntu, debian, and Suse Linux. Also an
    unfinished port for MS Windows.
  - added support for libnl-3 (which is incompatible with libnl-1 -
    netcf will use whichever is available, preferring libnl-3 unless
    told otherwise during configure stage)
  - add "bundled(gnulib)" to specfile to indicate that we use a local
    copy of gnulib sources (used by Fedora/RHEL when determining the scope
    of security bugs).
  - Fix ipcalc_netmask, which was trimming off the last digit in
    character representations of full-length netmasks (all 4 octets
    having 3 chars each)
  - other minor bugfixes

0.1.9 - 2011-07-26
  - always add <bridge> element to bridge, even if there is no physdev present
    (resolves: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=713180)
  - don't log error if interface isn't found in kernel during status report
    (resolves: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=713286
               https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698108
  - allow building with C++
  - update gnulib

0.1.8 - 2011-06-03
  - new transactional change APIs: ncf_change_(begin|commit|rollback)
  - add stdout/stderr to error text when an external program fails
  - make error reporting of failed execs more exact/correct
  - add "--system" to autogen.sh - sets all directories for standard system
    install.
  - change sysconfdir and localstatedir during config if basedir is /usr.
  - Remove unnecessary "Requires" of libxml2 and augeas from pkgconfig file
    to pulling in extra packages when building an application that uses netcf.
  - Reorganize code to simplify porting to other platforms.

0.1.7 - 2010-09-24
  - remove code that modifies iptables config for bridges
  - register gnulib as a proper submodule
  - don't delete physical interface config when defining a vlan
  - properly handle quoted entries in sysconfig files.
  - make miimon/arpmon optional

0.1.6 - 2010-04-15
  - only list devices that have an ifcfg file (BZ 580348)
  - improve run_program to close all open file descriptors before exec.
  - add missing includes for stat in src/dutil.c
  - add --debug option to ncftool - sets NETCF_DEBUG env variable
  - allow a one shot, non-interactive command in ncftool

0.1.5 - 2009-11-30
  - fix a couple of memory leaks (BZ 540521 and 540472)
  - do not require bridge module for succesful initialization

0.1.4 - 2009-11-05
  - ncf_if_xml_state: fill in details for bridge, bond, and vlan. The
    returned XML will now validate against interface.rng (except bonds,
    which are still missing the miimon or arpmon elements)
  - ncf_close: allow passing in a NULL ncf, or a partially initialized ncf
  - ncf_init: set *ncf to NULL when returning -2

0.1.3 - 2009-10-27
  - The interface.rng schema now allows specifying IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    in any order
  - ncf_if_status: new API call
  - ncf_if_xml_state: only report information about the live interface, and
    none of the information from configuration files; report interface
    type; report all addresses assigned to an interface; report MAC address
    of an interface
  - ncf_list_interfaces, ncf_num_interfaces, ncf_if_xml_state: fix bugs
    when dealing with interfaces that are down
  - ncf_if_mac_string: do not report error when MAC is not known, simply
    return NULL
  - use libnl to determine information about live interfaces

0.1.2 - 2009-09-25
  - Configure IPv6 addresses on interfaces (see tests/interface/ipv6-*.xml)
  - ncf_if_xml_state: new API call to get currently assigned IP of an
    interface (Laine Stump)

0.1.1 - 2009-09-16
  - Bridge: allow setting forward delay
  - Bridge: allow bridges with nothing enslaved
  - Bridge: allow enslaving a bond
  - Bond: properly translate numeric modes into textual modes
  - Lookup MAC's without regarding case (bz 512955)
  - Fix initialization of libxslt-1.1.24; this works around a threading bug
    in libxslt exposed by using netcf with libvirt (Daniel Veillard)
  - Print augeas initialization errors only when the environment variable
    NETCF_DEBUG exists (bz 513212)
  - Ignore the same backup etc. files ignored by the initscripts (bz 512950)
  - Search interface config files in the same manner as initscripts'
    need_config (bz 512950)
  - Only read/modify iptables and system-config-firewall when
    net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables sysctl is 1 (bz 517617)
  - Respect PREFIX in ifcfg file; if it's not there, continue to derive it
    from NETMASK
  - Properly propagate errors from running ifup/ifdown
  - ncf_define: fix removal of old interface config before redefining it
  - ncf_define: do not crash when defining a VLAN interface without a name
    (commit fb0543cc)
  - Move code around for upcoming SuSe driver (Jonas Eriksson)

0.1.0 - 2009-07-14
  - Stable API and XML schema; from now on, API and XML schema will only
    change in backwards compatible ways

  - toplevel interfaces are no longer required to have an address

  - ncf_num_of_interfaces, ncf_list_interfaces: allow filtering
    active/inactive interfaces (Laine Stump)
  - ncf_close: return int instead of void
  - initscripts driver: bring bridges up/down properly
